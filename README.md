# Modular Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Framework

A robust, modular, and extensible Python library implementing canonical Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, as described in the survey by Wang et al. This project is designed for research, experimentation, and practical application development.

## Features
- Implements value-based, policy-based, and maximum entropy DRL algorithms
- Modular architecture for extensibility and maintainability
- Reproducible experiments with YAML configuration files
- Comprehensive documentation and practical examples

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Core source code (algorithms, networks, buffers, environments, utils, evaluation)
- `configs/`: YAML configuration files for each algorithm
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and demonstration
- `docs/`: Detailed documentation (algorithms, usage, contributing)
- `examples/`: Example scripts for running agents

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run example scripts in the `examples/` directory
3. Explore and modify algorithms in `src/algorithms/`
