Environment Wrapper Implementation.

This module provides standardized wrappers for RL environments, as required by the Modular DRL Framework and described in "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al.

Detailed Description:
The environment wrapper ensures a consistent interface for agent-environment interaction, supporting OpenAI Gym and compatible APIs. It can preprocess observations, rewards, and actions, and is designed for extensibility to support custom or multi-agent environments. This abstraction enables seamless integration of new environments and facilitates reproducible experimentation.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Standardized environment interface
- Observation and reward preprocessing
- Compatibility with Gym and custom environments

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Environment name or specification (from config)
- Preprocessing options (e.g., normalization, frame stacking)
- All parameters are loaded from the relevant YAML config (e.g., `configs/dqn_config.yaml`)

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: environment step and reset calls, agent actions
- Outputs: processed observations, rewards, done flags, info dicts

Dependencies:
- gym, numpy
