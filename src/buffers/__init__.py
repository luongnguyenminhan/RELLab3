"""
Buffers Module.

This package provides experience replay buffer implementations for DRL algorithms, as described in the Modular DRL Framework and the survey by Wang et al.

Key Components:
- Uniform Replay Buffer (for off-policy learning)
- Prioritized Replay Buffer (for prioritized sampling)

Buffers are designed for efficient storage and sampling of transitions, supporting reproducibility and data efficiency.

Expected Usage:
- Used by DQN, DDPG, SAC, and other off-policy algorithms
- Configured via YAML files in `configs/`

Dependencies:
- numpy, collections
