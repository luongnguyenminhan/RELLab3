Prioritized Replay Buffer Implementation.

This module implements the prioritized experience replay buffer for DRL algorithms, as described in the Modular DRL Framework and "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al.

Detailed Description:
Prioritized replay samples transitions with higher learning potential (e.g., larger TD error) more frequently, accelerating convergence and improving data efficiency. It uses stochastic prioritization and importance sampling to balance efficiency and diversity. The buffer is configurable via YAML files and is used by advanced DQN variants and other algorithms supporting prioritized replay.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Prioritized experience replay
- Stochastic prioritization
- Importance sampling for bias correction
- Buffer management (add, sample, update priorities)

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Buffer size
- Batch size
- Prioritization exponent (alpha)
- Importance sampling exponent (beta)
- All parameters are loaded from the relevant YAML config (e.g., `configs/dqn_config.yaml`)

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: transitions (state, action, reward, next_state, done), priorities
- Outputs: sampled mini-batches with importance weights

Dependencies:
- numpy, collections
