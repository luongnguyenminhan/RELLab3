Replay Buffer Implementation.

This module implements the standard uniform experience replay buffer for off-policy DRL algorithms, as described in the Modular DRL Framework and "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al.

Detailed Description:
The replay buffer stores agent-environment transitions (state, action, reward, next_state, done) and enables random sampling for training, breaking temporal correlations and improving data efficiency. It supports reproducibility and is configurable via YAML files. Used by DQN, DDPG, SAC, and other off-policy algorithms.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Uniform experience replay
- Random sampling for mini-batch updates
- Buffer management (add, sample, clear)

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Buffer size
- Batch size
- All parameters are loaded from the relevant YAML config (e.g., `configs/dqn_config.yaml`)

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: transitions (state, action, reward, next_state, done)
- Outputs: sampled mini-batches for training

Dependencies:
- numpy, collections
