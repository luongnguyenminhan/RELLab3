Dueling Network Architecture Implementation.

This module implements the Dueling Network architecture for Q-value estimation, as described in "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al. and the Modular DRL Framework engineering blueprint.

Detailed Description:
The Dueling Network separates the estimation of state-value and advantage functions within the Q-network, improving learning efficiency and stability in value-based DRL algorithms. This architecture is particularly effective in environments with many similar-valued actions. The module is designed for extensibility and integration with DQN and its variants.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Dueling Q-Network architecture
- Separate value and advantage streams
- Aggregation of value and advantage to compute Q-values
- PyTorch-based modular implementation

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Network layer sizes and activation functions (from YAML config)
- Initialization schemes
- All parameters are loaded from the relevant YAML config (e.g., `configs/dqn_config.yaml`)

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: state (numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor)
- Outputs: Q-values for all actions (torch.Tensor)

Dependencies:
- torch, numpy
