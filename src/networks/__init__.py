"""
Networks Module.

This package defines neural network architectures used by DRL algorithms in the Modular DRL Framework, as described in the survey by Wang et al.

Key Components:
- Q-Networks (for value-based methods)
- Policy Networks (for actor-critic and policy-based methods)
- Value Networks (for critic estimation)
- Dueling Networks (for advanced Q-value estimation)

Networks are implemented using PyTorch and are designed for flexibility and extensibility.

Expected Usage:
- Instantiated by algorithm modules for function approximation
- Configurable via YAML files in `configs/`

Dependencies:
- torch, numpy
