Q-Network Implementation.

This module implements Q-network architectures for value-based DRL algorithms, as described in "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al. and the Modular DRL Framework engineering blueprint.

Detailed Description:
The Q-network estimates the action-value function, mapping state-action pairs to expected returns. It is a core component of algorithms such as DQN and its variants. The module is designed for flexibility, supporting different network depths, activation functions, and integration with target networks. All configurations are managed via YAML files for reproducibility.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Q-value function approximation
- Target network support
- PyTorch-based modular implementation

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Network architecture (layer sizes, activations)
- Initialization schemes
- All parameters are loaded from the relevant YAML config (e.g., `configs/dqn_config.yaml`)

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: state (numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor)
- Outputs: Q-values for all actions (torch.Tensor)

Dependencies:
- torch, numpy
