Value Network Implementation.

This module implements value network architectures for critic estimation in actor-critic and maximum entropy-based DRL algorithms, as described in "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al. and the Modular DRL Framework engineering blueprint.

Detailed Description:
The value network estimates the state-value function, which is used for baseline estimation, advantage calculation, and policy evaluation. It is a key component in algorithms such as PPO and SAC. The design is modular and configurable, supporting different network depths and activation functions, with all parameters managed via YAML files for reproducibility.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- State-value function approximation
- Baseline estimation for policy gradients
- PyTorch-based modular implementation

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Network architecture (layer sizes, activations)
- Initialization schemes
- All parameters are loaded from the relevant YAML config (e.g., `configs/ppo_config.yaml`)

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: state (numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor)
- Outputs: state value (torch.Tensor)

Dependencies:
- torch, numpy
