Policy Network Implementation.

This module implements policy network architectures for actor-critic and policy-based DRL algorithms, as described in "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al. and the Modular DRL Framework engineering blueprint.

Detailed Description:
The policy network is responsible for mapping observed states to actions, supporting both deterministic and stochastic policies. It is used in algorithms such as DDPG, PPO, and SAC. The design is modular, allowing for easy customization of network depth, activation functions, and output distributions. Configuration is managed via YAML files for reproducibility and experiment tracking.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Deterministic and stochastic policy parameterization
- Action sampling and squashing (e.g., tanh for bounded actions)
- PyTorch-based modular implementation

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Network architecture (layer sizes, activations)
- Output distribution type (Gaussian, Beta, etc.)
- All parameters are loaded from the relevant YAML config (e.g., `configs/ppo_config.yaml`)

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: state (numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor)
- Outputs: action (numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor), action distribution (if stochastic)

Dependencies:
- torch, numpy
