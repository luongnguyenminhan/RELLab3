SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) Algorithm Implementation.

This module implements the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, a maximum entropy-based DRL method as described in Section III.C of "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al. and the Modular DRL Framework blueprint.

Detailed Description:
SAC is an off-policy, actor-critic algorithm that maximizes both expected reward and policy entropy, encouraging robust exploration and optimal stochastic policies. It integrates temperature (entropy regularization), experience replay, and target networks for stable and efficient learning. The module is designed for modularity, reproducibility, and extensibility, with all hyperparameters managed via YAML configuration.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Maximum entropy RL objective
- Actor-Critic architecture
- Temperature (entropy) parameter
- Experience Replay buffer
- Target Network

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Learning rate, discount factor (gamma), batch size
- Temperature parameter (alpha)
- Actor and Critic network architectures
- Replay buffer size and sampling
- All parameters are loaded from `configs/sac_config.yaml`

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: state (numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor), action, reward, next_state, done
- Outputs: updated policy and value networks, training metrics

Dependencies:
- torch, numpy, gym, PyYAML
- src/networks/policy_network.py, src/networks/q_network.py
- src/buffers/replay_buffer.py
