"""
Algorithms Module.

This package contains the core Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm implementations for the Modular DRL Framework, as classified in "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al.

Key Algorithms:
- DQN (Deep Q-Network)
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)
- SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)

Each algorithm integrates canonical improvements (e.g., experience replay, target networks, trust region, entropy regularization) and is designed for modularity and extensibility.

Expected Usage:
- Import and instantiate algorithm classes for training and evaluation
- Algorithms are configured via YAML files in `configs/`

Dependencies:
- torch, numpy, gym, PyYAML
