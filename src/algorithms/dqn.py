DQN (Deep Q-Network) Algorithm Implementation.

This module implements the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, a foundational value-based DRL method as described in Section III.A of "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al. and the Modular DRL Framework blueprint.

Detailed Description:
DQN combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to approximate the action-value function for high-dimensional state spaces. It integrates key improvements such as experience replay, target networks, and ϵ-greedy exploration to stabilize training and improve data efficiency. Double DQN (DDQN) is supported as a configurable option to mitigate Q-value overestimation. The module is designed for modularity and extensibility, supporting reproducible research and practical applications.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks
- Experience Replay buffer
- Target Network
- ϵ-greedy exploration
- Double DQN (configurable)

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Learning rate, discount factor (gamma), batch size
- Replay buffer size and sampling
- Target network update frequency
- ϵ-greedy parameters (epsilon, decay)
- All parameters are loaded from `configs/dqn_config.yaml`

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: state (numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor), action, reward, next_state, done
- Outputs: updated Q-network, training metrics

Dependencies:
- torch, numpy, gym, PyYAML
- src/networks/q_network.py, src/buffers/replay_buffer.py
