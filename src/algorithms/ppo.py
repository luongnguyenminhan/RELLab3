PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) Algorithm Implementation.

This module implements the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a canonical policy-based DRL method as described in Section III.B of "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al. and the Modular DRL Framework blueprint.

Detailed Description:
PPO is an on-policy, actor-critic algorithm that uses a clipped surrogate objective to ensure stable and monotonic policy updates. It supports both discrete and continuous action spaces and leverages advantage estimation for efficient learning. The module is designed for modularity, reproducibility, and extensibility, with all hyperparameters managed via YAML configuration.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Actor-Critic architecture
- Clipped surrogate objective (trust region)
- Advantage estimation (GAE)
- Policy and value networks

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Learning rate, discount factor (gamma), batch size
- Clipping parameter (epsilon)
- Advantage estimation parameters (lambda)
- Policy and value network architectures
- All parameters are loaded from `configs/ppo_config.yaml`

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: state (numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor), action, reward, next_state, done
- Outputs: updated policy and value networks, training metrics

Dependencies:
- torch, numpy, gym, PyYAML
- src/networks/policy_network.py, src/networks/value_network.py
