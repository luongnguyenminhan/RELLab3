DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) Algorithm Implementation.

This module implements the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, a canonical policy-based DRL method as described in Section III.B of "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al. and the Modular DRL Framework engineering blueprint.

Detailed Description:
DDPG is an off-policy, actor-critic algorithm designed for continuous action spaces. It leverages deterministic policy gradients, experience replay, and target networks (with soft updates) to achieve stable and efficient learning. The algorithm integrates Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise for exploration and supports modular configuration via YAML files. DDPG is foundational for advanced methods such as TD3 and is a key representative of policy-based DRL in this framework.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG)
- Actor-Critic architecture
- Experience Replay buffer
- Target Network with soft updates (Polyak averaging)
- Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise for exploration

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Learning rate, discount factor (gamma), batch size
- Actor and Critic network architectures
- Replay buffer size and sampling
- Soft update parameter (tau)
- Noise process parameters
- All parameters are loaded from `configs/ddpg_config.yaml`

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: state (numpy.ndarray or torch.Tensor), action, reward, next_state, done
- Outputs: updated policy and value networks, training metrics

Dependencies:
- torch, numpy, gym, PyYAML
- src/networks/policy_network.py, src/networks/q_network.py
- src/buffers/replay_buffer.py, src/utils/noise.py
