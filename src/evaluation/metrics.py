Metrics Evaluation Module.

This module provides standardized metrics calculation utilities for evaluating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms in the Modular DRL Framework, as outlined in "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al. and the project engineering blueprint.

Detailed Description:
The metrics module enables quantitative assessment of agent performance, learning progress, and experiment reproducibility. It includes functions for computing cumulative rewards, episode lengths, moving averages, statistical summaries, and other key evaluation metrics. These metrics are essential for comparing algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, and reporting results in a reproducible manner. The design supports extensibility for custom metrics and integrates seamlessly with the framework's logging and plotting utilities.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Cumulative reward and episode return calculation
- Episode length and success rate tracking
- Moving average and smoothing for learning curves
- Statistical summaries (mean, std, min, max)
- Extensible metric registration for custom evaluation

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Metrics to compute (specified in config or script)
- Smoothing window size for moving averages
- Logging frequency and output format
- All parameters are configurable via YAML files in `configs/`

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: lists or arrays of rewards, episode results, agent-environment interaction data
- Outputs: computed metrics (floats, arrays, dicts), ready for logging or plotting

Dependencies:
- numpy, collections
- src/utils/logger.py (for logging results)
