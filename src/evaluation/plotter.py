Plotter Evaluation Module.

This module provides plotting and visualization utilities for analyzing the performance of DRL algorithms in the Modular DRL Framework, as described in "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al. and the project engineering blueprint.

Detailed Description:
The plotter module enables the creation of publication-quality visualizations for training curves, evaluation metrics, and experiment comparisons. It supports line plots, bar charts, and statistical overlays for cumulative rewards, losses, and other tracked metrics. The design emphasizes reproducibility, clarity, and extensibility, allowing users to customize plots for different experiments and reporting needs. Integration with the metrics and logger modules ensures seamless workflow from data collection to visualization.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Training curve visualization (reward, loss, etc.)
- Comparison of multiple runs or algorithms
- Smoothing and moving average overlays
- Customizable plot styles and export options
- Support for reproducible figure generation

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Metrics to plot (from config or script)
- Smoothing window size and plot style
- Output directory and file format (e.g., PNG, PDF)
- All parameters are configurable via YAML files in `configs/`

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: computed metrics (lists, arrays, dicts), log files
- Outputs: saved plot images, optionally displayed interactively

Dependencies:
- matplotlib, seaborn (optional), numpy
- src/evaluation/metrics.py (for metric data)
