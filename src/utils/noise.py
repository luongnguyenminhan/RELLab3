"""
Noise Utilities Module.

This module provides noise process implementations for exploration in DRL algorithms, as described in "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al. and the Modular DRL Framework engineering blueprint.

Detailed Description:
The noise module implements stochastic processes such as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and Gaussian noise, which are used to encourage exploration in continuous action spaces. These utilities are essential for algorithms like DDPG and SAC. The design is modular, allowing easy extension and configuration via YAML files.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for temporally correlated noise
- Gaussian noise for uncorrelated exploration
- Configurable noise parameters for reproducibility

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Noise type and parameters (mean, std, theta, dt)
- All parameters are loaded from the relevant YAML config (e.g., `configs/ddpg_config.yaml`)

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: action dimension, current action (optional)
- Outputs: noise sample (numpy.ndarray or float)

Dependencies:
- numpy
