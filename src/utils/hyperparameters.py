"""
Hyperparameters Utilities Module.

This module provides utilities for loading, validating, and managing hyperparameters in the Modular DRL Framework, as described in "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al. and the project engineering blueprint.

Detailed Description:
The hyperparameters module ensures reproducibility and configurability by centralizing the management of all experiment and algorithm parameters. It supports loading hyperparameters from YAML files, validating their types and ranges, and providing easy access throughout the framework. This design enables systematic experimentation and comparison of DRL algorithms.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- YAML-based configuration management
- Hyperparameter validation and defaulting
- Support for experiment reproducibility and logging

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Path to YAML config files (e.g., `configs/dqn_config.yaml`)
- Validation schemas and default values

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: YAML configuration files
- Outputs: validated hyperparameter dictionaries or objects

Dependencies:
- PyYAML, os, typing
