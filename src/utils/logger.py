Logger Utilities Module.

This module provides logging utilities for experiment tracking and reproducibility in the Modular DRL Framework, as described in "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al. and the project engineering blueprint.

Detailed Description:
The logger module enables systematic recording of training progress, evaluation metrics, hyperparameters, and experiment metadata. It supports logging to console, files, and TensorBoard, facilitating analysis and reproducibility. The design is modular and extensible, allowing integration with custom loggers and external tools.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Structured experiment logging
- Support for multiple output formats (console, file, TensorBoard)
- Logging of hyperparameters and results for reproducibility

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Log file paths and formats
- Logging frequency and verbosity
- TensorBoard directory (if used)

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: metrics, hyperparameters, experiment metadata
- Outputs: log files, console output, TensorBoard summaries

Dependencies:
- logging, os, tensorboardX (optional)
