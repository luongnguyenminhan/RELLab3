Algorithm Documentation.

This file provides detailed documentation for each DRL algorithm implemented in the Modular DRL Framework, following the structure and analysis from "Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey" by Wang et al.

Key Concepts/Sections:
- Value-based methods (DQN, DDQN, Rainbow, etc.)
- Policy-based methods (PPO, DDPG, etc.)
- Maximum entropy methods (SAC, Soft Q-Learning)
- Core improvements: Experience Replay, Target Networks, Dueling Architecture, Prioritized Replay, etc.
- Mapping of theoretical concepts to code modules

Expected Usage:
- Reference for theoretical background and implementation details of each algorithm
- Guide for extending or modifying algorithm modules

Dependencies:
- None (Markdown documentation)
