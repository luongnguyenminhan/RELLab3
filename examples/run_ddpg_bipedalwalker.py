Example Script: Run DDPG on BipedalWalker.

This script demonstrates how to train a DDPG agent on the BipedalWalker environment using the Modular DRL Framework, as described in the DRL survey and project engineering blueprint.

Detailed Description:
The script loads the DDPG algorithm, environment, and hyperparameters from YAML configuration files. It initializes the agent, environment, and logger, then runs the training loop, logging results and saving checkpoints for reproducibility. The example serves as a template for running other continuous control experiments.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- DDPG algorithm for continuous action spaces
- Modular configuration and reproducibility
- Logging and checkpointing of training progress

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Environment: BipedalWalker-v3
- Algorithm: DDPG (parameters from `configs/ddpg_config.yaml`)
- Logging and checkpoint directories

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: YAML config files, environment spec
- Outputs: training logs, saved models, evaluation metrics

Dependencies:
- torch, numpy, gym, PyYAML, matplotlib, tensorboard, tqdm
- src/algorithms/ddpg.py, src/networks/policy_network.py, src/networks/q_network.py, src/buffers/replay_buffer.py, src/utils/logger.py
