"""
Unit Tests for Algorithms.

This module contains unit tests for the core DRL algorithm implementations in the Modular DRL Framework, as described in the DRL survey and project engineering blueprint.

Detailed Description:
Tests in this module validate the correctness, stability, and reproducibility of value-based, policy-based, and maximum entropy-based algorithms (e.g., DQN, PPO, DDPG, SAC). Each test targets algorithm logic, update steps, and edge cases using mock data and controlled random seeds. The structure supports extensibility for new algorithms and improvements.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Isolated testing of algorithm update logic
- Mocking of environment and network outputs
- Reproducibility checks via random seeds

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Test configuration files (if needed)
- Random seed specification for reproducibility

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: mock transitions, hyperparameters, network outputs
- Outputs: pass/fail results, coverage reports

Dependencies:
- pytest, unittest, numpy, torch, mock (if needed)
