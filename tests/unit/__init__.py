"""
Unit Tests Package.

This package contains unit tests for the Modular DRL Framework, ensuring correctness and reliability of individual modules as described in the project engineering blueprint and DRL survey.

Detailed Description:
Unit tests are designed to validate the core logic, edge cases, and reproducibility of algorithms, buffers, networks, environments, and utilities. Each test targets a specific function or class, using mock data and controlled environments to ensure deterministic outcomes. The structure supports extensibility for new modules and features.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- Isolated testing of core components
- Mocking and controlled random seeds for reproducibility
- Coverage of edge cases and failure modes

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Test configuration files (if needed)
- Random seed specification for reproducibility

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: mock data, test cases
- Outputs: pass/fail results, coverage reports

Dependencies:
- pytest, unittest, mock (if needed)
