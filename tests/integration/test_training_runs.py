Integration Test: Training Runs.

This module contains integration tests for end-to-end training runs in the Modular DRL Framework, as described in the DRL survey and project engineering blueprint.

Detailed Description:
Tests in this module validate the interaction between algorithms, networks, buffers, environments, and utilities during full training cycles. Each test simulates a realistic experiment, verifying reproducibility, logging, and correct output generation. The structure supports extensibility for new experiment pipelines and evaluation protocols.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- End-to-end training and evaluation
- Reproducibility checks (random seeds, config logging)
- Validation of experiment outputs and logs

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Experiment configuration files (YAML)
- Random seed specification for reproducibility

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: experiment configs, environment specs
- Outputs: pass/fail results, experiment logs, output files

Dependencies:
- pytest, unittest, gym, numpy, torch
