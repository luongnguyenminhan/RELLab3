"""
Integration Tests Package.

This package contains integration tests for the Modular DRL Framework, validating the interaction between multiple modules and the reproducibility of end-to-end experiments, as described in the project engineering blueprint and DRL survey.

Detailed Description:
Integration tests ensure that algorithms, networks, buffers, environments, and utilities work together as intended. These tests simulate realistic training and evaluation scenarios, verifying experiment reproducibility, logging, and configuration management. The structure supports extensibility for new features and experiment pipelines.

Key Concepts/Algorithms:
- End-to-end testing of DRL pipelines
- Reproducibility checks (random seeds, config logging)
- Validation of experiment outputs and logs

Important Parameters/Configurations:
- Experiment configuration files (YAML)
- Random seed specification for reproducibility

Expected Inputs/Outputs:
- Inputs: experiment configs, environment specs
- Outputs: pass/fail results, experiment logs, output files

Dependencies:
- pytest, unittest, gym, numpy
